This repo is dedicated to a Udemy tutorial titled [Git a Web Developer Job: Mastering the Modern Workflow](https://www.udemy.com/git-a-web-developer-job-mastering-the-modern-workflow/learn/v4/overview). It is the first substantial project I created using SASS, NPM, and Gulp as part of my workflow. For more information see the [project website](https://pulamusic.github.io/travel-site/).
