# travel-site

A repo created from a Udemy.com tutorial titled [Git a Web Developer Job: Mastering the Modern Workflow](https://www.udemy.com/git-a-web-developer-job-mastering-the-modern-workflow/learn/v4/content). This is the first site I have created using Gulp, modular JavaScript, and BEM best practices.
